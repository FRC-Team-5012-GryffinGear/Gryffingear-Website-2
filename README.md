Website Human Code (Team Site)

The team makes a website to keep track of where things are and when things are occuring. This is the code for the team website. Over time it changes so a new website is made. This is the second team website which is made to be an improvement of the old site. [Click here for a preview](http://nats-ohchewy.github.io/Gryffingear-Website-2/).
